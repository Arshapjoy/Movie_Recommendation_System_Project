# Movie_Recommendation_System_Project


Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project repository! This project aims to develop a content-based movie recommendation system utilizing data from Rotten Tomatoes. By analyzing various movie features such as audience scores, critic reviews, genres, directors, and more, the system provides personalized recommendations tailored to individual preferences.

## Project Structure

1. **datasets/**: This directory contains the Rotten Tomatoes datasets used for the project.
   - `rotten_tomatoes_movies.csv`: Dataset containing movie information such as titles, audience scores, genres, directors, etc.
   - `rotten_tomatoes_movie_reviews.csv`: Dataset containing critic reviews for movies, including review scores, publication names, etc.

2. **notebooks/**: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
   - `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
   - `02_eda.ipynb`: Notebook for exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
   - `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Notebook for feature extraction and engineering.
   - `04_model_training.ipynb`: Notebook for model selection, training, and recommendation generation.
   - `05_evaluation.ipynb`: Notebook for evaluating the performance of the recommendation system.
   - `06_final_notebook.ipynb`: Notebook with all the codes

3. **src/**: (UPCOMING)

    This directory will contain source code files for the recommendation system implementation.
   - `recommendation_system.py`: Python script containing functions/classes for recommendation system implementation.
   - `utils.py`: Python script containing utility functions used across the project.

5. **requirements.txt**: File listing all Python dependencies required to run the project.

6. **README.md**: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
7. **Documentation**: This directory will contain all the documentation about this project
